    <string name="about_desc1">Created by: Daniela Pavlenco</string>
    <string name="about_desc2">This app was created as part of Daniela Pavlenco\'s bachelor thesis at the Polytechnic University of Timisoara. It helps you monitor and manage your Android device\'s hardware and software, providing features like CPU, GPU, and memory usage statistics, display settings management, app management, and battery/performance optimization.\n\nIn recent times, many features are being taken away from users with each Android update, leading to less control over devices that they own. This app was made to demonstrate the possibilities even within the current limits, giving users more control over their devices and showing what can still be achieved."</string>


    <string name="faq_question1">Why was the app made?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer1">Amidst a time when Google keeps taking away device-related permissions from its users with each Android update, I, the developer decided it was the right time to show the capabilities of device customization and control before that is all inevitably discontinued in future updates. Rooting your device seems to have become the only way to fully utilize most options, and certain features that used to work without root were still implemented in the app and can be used with older phones.</string>

    <string name="faq_question2">What is the purpose of this app?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer2">This app is designed to help users monitor and manage various aspects of their Android device\'s hardware and software. It provides detailed statistics on CPU, GPU, network and memory usage, allows display settings customization, app management, and offers tools to optimize battery and performance settings.</string>

    <string name="faq_question3">What phones was this app tested on during development?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer3">This app was mainly tested on an unrooted Samsung Galaxy S23 and an emulated rooted Google Pixel 6 with API Level 33. The rooting was done using RootAVD + Magisk, which we recommend to all users that wish to try out rooted options before trying it on real phones.</string>

    <string name="faq_question4">Does this app require root access?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer4">Some features of this app require root access to function properly, such as advanced performance tweaks and certain system-level changes. However, many features, like monitoring and basic app management, do not require root access.</string>

    <string name="faq_question5">Why is there a terminal?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer5">The main functionalities of this app are done using commands sent to the runtime of the Android operating system, the terminal is a perfect way to test commands from within the device.</string>

    <string name="faq_question6">What is the WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer6">The WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission allows apps to modify secure system settings, such as enabling or disabling features like developer options, changing display settings, and adjusting network configurations. This permission is highly restricted because it can affect the overall behavior and security of the device.</string>

    <string name="faq_question7">What is ADB and how do I use it?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer7">ADB (Android Debug Bridge) is a versatile command-line tool that allows you to communicate with your Android device from a computer. It facilitates various tasks, such as installing and debugging apps, accessing device logs, and running shell commands. ADB is an essential tool for developers and advanced users who want to manage their devices more effectively.</string>

    <string name="faq_question8">What is root access and why do I need it?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer8">Root access is the ability to gain administrative privileges on your Android device. With root access, you can modify system files, access restricted areas of the operating system, and perform actions that are not available to regular users. Our app requires root access for advanced features such as performance tweaks, system-level changes, and certain app management functions. Please note that rooting your device can void your warranty and may pose security risks. Ensure you understand the implications before proceeding.</string>

    <string name="faq_question9">How do I root my device?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer9">Rooting your device involves unlocking the bootloader and installing a custom recovery, followed by flashing a root package (such as Magisk or SuperSU). The process varies between devices, so it\'s essential to follow a detailed guide specific to your device model. Be cautious, as incorrect steps can lead to data loss or bricking your device.</string>
